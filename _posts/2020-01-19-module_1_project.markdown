It is unbelievable how much I and my Data Science cohorts have learned in just a few weeks! With the help of our instructor (love you, Rafael) and through exhaustive lessons and studying we have made it to our first project. This project is based on the fictitional premise of Microsoft entering the movie production business. 

#### The Project 
We have been tasked with finding useful insights while practicing our new exploratory skills in data analysis. Our premise is to investigate the available data to assist Microsoft as they begin a movie industry. Our analysis should include assessments on what makes a box office success. 

#### The Process
Through databases we will go...Using SQL queries combining a variety of tables and files I was able to search, sort, and tabulate all manner of data. Using the managed data I was then able to create useful tables, charts and graphs to answer what I hope are relevant questions.

I'm told it will get easier! 

#### The Results
* The top three production companies
* Top genres and ones to avoid
* Appropriate lengths of movies

I'll not list the actual results here since we are also learning data cleaning and didn't have time to properly clean all data as it was not the focus of our project. Some of the results may be a bit off due to missing data values (a lesson learned).

#### The Conclusion
I look forward to the days ahead as I'm sure we've only scratched the surface of our Data Science adventure!
