Volunteer!

Opportunities abound! My instructor mentioned 'you might see if anyone needs a data scientist' to practice your skills with real world analysis. So I asked a friend/former student/businessman if he knew of anyone who needed the skills of a data scientist so I can practice. I'm now assisting a leading historical foundation to wrap up the data analysis for their grant. So thankful for this opportunity!
