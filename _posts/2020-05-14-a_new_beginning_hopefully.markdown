The last five months have been some of the most challenging and yet most fullfilling of my educational experiences and I have three advanced degrees. The journey to a career in data science is only partially complete. The framework has been set and I'm ready to move in. Flatiron has provided a solid program, fantastic instruction with encouraging and exciting people. 

Now a different kind of work is before me - resumes, prep for technical interviews, and electronic networking . All the entities required to land the next dream job are before me and I'm ready. I'm so glad I'm not kicked out the door left to navigate this job hunting jungle on my own. Wish me luck!
