Searching for a new career to use coding skills acquired in the last years of my teaching career, I stumbled upon the Flatiron school and thier coding bootcamps. I love the idea of learning and needed to increase my foundation choosing Data Science to merge my love of mathematics and coding. I've joined ATLytiCS: Analytics for Good volunteer organization and hope to be soon be able to contribute through my data science journey.
