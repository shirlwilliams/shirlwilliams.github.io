I wasn't happy with my project. Everyone else was able to use machine learning with their project. My project didn't lend itself to a good machine learning model but had some fantastic use of graphics and EDA. As much as I love creating graphical representations of my data, I wanted to use my newly learned skills. So...I changed my project. It wasn't perfect, but was tremendously satisfying. I finished it in two and a half days!
