My first meaningful foray into statistics came about  with the advent of Texas Instruments teacher training labs. I hate to admit, until the hands on approach was presented, statistics for me was a jumble. In my data science journey, I have refreshed my recollection of many topics  I *never thought I would use* (one mantra of math teachers) and added new features to my collection. I also found several clarifying explanations and videos I wish I had way back when.

I love that data science incorporates my favorites: math and computer science!
